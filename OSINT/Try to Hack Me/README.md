# Try to hack me | noob_abhinav

- Description: My friend `brayannoob` gave me a ctf challenge and told me `Try to hack me`

# Write-up

So it's a very easy challenge. We are given a name i.e `brayannoob` so we see an github account with the name and see 3 repo when we see the commits of the pinned repo we see some commits when check that we find some username now according to challenge name the username is of Tryhackme so going to `https://tryhackme.com/p/brayan234` we can see the flag.

# Flag :- n00bz{y0u_p4ss3d_th3_ch4ll3ng3_c0ngr4tul4t10ns_7c48179d2b7547938409152641cf8e}
