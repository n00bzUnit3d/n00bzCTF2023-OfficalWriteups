# To_the_MOOON! | 0xBlue

- Description: Because cryptocurrency is entirely unhackable, everyone's tokens are going to the MOOOON! Everyone's but mine, that is. How about this: if you can get my TTMCOIN's price high enough, I'll give you the flag. That sound fair?

- **Required Note 1:** This chall has to be solved in remix - https://remix.ethereum.org/, using the first address shown(`0x5b3...eddc4`)
- **Required Note 2:** The final flag is the transaction hash from calling the `solve()` function(as a string) XORed with `575105531e4f120e1c6d115d5d126d5d4e3a43590f59074439425a525616515f5b4e4c5b000057434d475b416f4e5b57473c0848694158095b56173b170a5d51`(as hex)
- **Required Note 3:** The flag "repeats" in the output you get, but it should be clear what to submit. If not, please open a ticket.
-  Note 4: If the output isn't wrapped in `n00bz{...}`. you may need to reload the page, and solve the chall in as few steps as possible. If it still isn't working but you have a solution, we'll give you the flag.

> Ex: If you get `0x7bff` as the hash, you should xor "7bff"(as a string) with `575105531e4f120e1c6d115d5d126d5d4e3a43590f59074439425a525616515f5b4e4c5b000057434d475b416f4e5b57473c0848694158095b56173b170a5d51`(as hex).
> The output will already be wrapped in `n00bz{...}`
