- Description: My friend loves Chemistry very much specially the elements. Once I asked him the wifi password he gave me some numbers like `186808155710` and told me that the number are in group of two like `1008` -> `10 and 08/8`. Can you help to gather the wifi password? (Note: It forms a complete word, so you might have to leave out something).

A very easy challenge and a logical challenge where the user have to use their mind. The number given are the atomic number of elements. So apon seeing the periodic table you'll get to know that the password is `aeroplane`.
