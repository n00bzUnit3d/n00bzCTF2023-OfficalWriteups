- Note: The server is not slow, but I have add sleep(0.5) to discourage server-overloading

# Writeup

`e` is 17 so you can send 17 requests to get 17 ciphertexts and modulos, then do Hastad Broadcast Attack - comput crt() then take the e-th root to get the flag!

# Flag - n00bz{5m4ll_3_1s_n3v3r_g00d!}
